# Browser Technologies 

For this course we had to create a demo on the basis of a user story. The goal was to create a project using *Porgressiev Enhancement* and *Feature Detection*. Using these things we want to make it so that our project and our main feature always works no matter what the user has turned off or on what kind of device or browser the user is accessing the project on.

# User Story

For this project, we had the option to chose from a list of 6 User Stories. I was reading all of the user stories and there was one in particular that struck my interest. I have the bad personality trait of thinking I can do the hardest and most difficult things. The fact that the other ones didnt really sound interesting, I chose for the Nerdy T-shirt user story. Which is as follows:

*I want to customize my own t-shirt with a text on it. I want to be able to save and order the shirts and use it the next time I visit the site.*

# Features

For this User Story, there were a few requirements that needed to be included in this project. 
- Personal Info (name, phone, email)
- Color of t-shirt
- Text for on t-shirt
- Size of t-shirt
- Male of Female
- Continue where you left
- Validation, everything needed to be filled in
- Be able to create multiple shirts
- Order page to buy en show the designs

This is a pretty long list and it sounds really challenging. I chose this user story because I like the way it sounded.
